          <h2>Copyright law</h2>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rights to authorship and names: forever!
            </li>
            <li>
              Exclusive rights: up to 100 years

          <aside class="notes">
              Any software or database, 
              like a book or photo, is the subject of copyright law. 
              Copyright law includes a number of specific rights. I’ll mention the right to authorship and the right to name, 
              these rights are reserved for the creator forever. 
              This means that no one will ever be able to announce that he is the author of the software you created. 
              Another major right is the exclusive right, which is reserved for the author or his heirs for a very long time, 
              depending on the country, up to 100 years. 
              All this time, the author has the ability to determine how his work can be used. 
              The author of a work may notify about his exclusive right by placing a well-known copyright mark on copies of the work. 
              After the expiration of the period of exclusive rights or at the request of the author, 
              the work/software passes into the public domain and can be used by all without any restrictions.
              Up to this point, the author grants rights to use the work / software by concluding a license agreement or granting a license.

                The remaining types of licenses are public licenses. They allow creators to preserve copyrights, 
                while at the same time allowing others to copy, distribute and use their works/software, at least for non-commercial purposes.

            <h2>Open source software licensing</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                Historically, both types appeared and began to develop at the same time in the second half of the 1980s, 
                during the emergence of movements supporting the free distribution of software and the distribution of open source software. 
                Both types of licenses in one or another way give the right to run, study, share, and modify the software.

            <br>
            <p>The main difference is <br> under what conditions you can distribute derivative software.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Copyleft licenses require that any derivative software has to be distributed under the same licensing conditions as the base one. 
                And permissive licenses allow you to distribute derivative software on other conditions, including making it proprietary.

                It resolved two major problems.
                The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only
                 - executable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. 
                To prevent this, GPL stated that if you copy and distribute copies of the software 
                you must also make the source code available under the same licensing terms.
                The second problem was that distributors might add restrictions on the distribution of the software. 
                To prevent this, GPL stated that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPL.

                Historically, the most used were the GPL licenses. 
                First of all, this was due to the fact that free software was created by enthusiasts inspired by the ideology of free software distribution.

            <aside class="notes">
                And final question. What kins of license should I use?  
                if you use open source software within your software development project, 
                any permissive license should be fine. 
                But while understanding the differences between permissive licenses is important, 
                far more important is drawing the line between them and their unfriendly counterparts, copyleft.
                If you are a user of open source components,
                 copyleft licenses can “infect” your entire code base and impose restrictions that might prevent you from commercializing. 
                If you are a developer of open source software,
                 copyleft can significantly limit the appeal and adoption of your components.
