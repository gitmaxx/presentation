Today i’m going to tell about software licensing.

next slide

Any software or database,
like a book or photo, is the subject of copyright law.
Copyright law includes a number of specific rights. I’ll mention the right to authorship and the right to name,
these rights are reserved for the creator forever.
This means that no one will ever be able to announce that he is the author of the software you created.
Another major right is the exclusive right, which is reserved for the author or his heirs for a very long time,
depending on the country, up to 100 years.
All this time, the author has the ability to determine how his work can be used.
The author of a work may notify about his exclusive right by placing a well-known copyright mark on copies of the work.
After the expiration of the period of exclusive rights or at the request of the author,
the work/software passes into the public domain and can be used by all without any restrictions.
Up to this point, the author grants rights to use the work / software by concluding a license agreement or granting a license.

What types of licenses exist.
There are four major types: proprietary licences, protective or copyleft licenses, permissive licenses, public domain -like licenses.
next slide
First  type: proprietary licenses.
This type is used for commercial software.
In this case, the author of the software indicates all the conditions for using the software in an end-user license agreement (EULA).

next slide

License agreements are usually not negotiable.
 Rights to use the source code are not granted.
Usually, redistribution is also prohibited in this case.

next slide

The remaining types of licenses are public licenses.
They allow creators to preserve copyrights,
while at the same time allowing others to copy, distribute and use their works/software, at least for non-commercial purposes.

next slide

The first type is in this group: licenses which are analogues of the public domain.
In fact, this is a legal way to get rid of the maximum possible set of rights.

next slide

Creative Commons Zero license is a preferred way to put software to the public domain.
In general, Creative Commons is a set of licenses (you can say a framework)
that is widely used for licensing art objects: photos, videos, etc.
These licenses are not recommended for licensing software
since they do not take into account the specifics of software distribution.
But Creative Commons Zero is an exception and can and should be used for software.

next slide

We have two types of public licenses left:
two pillars of the distribution of free software and open source software:
permissive licenses and copyleft licenses.

next slide

Historically, both types appeared and began to develop at the same time in the second half of the 1980s,
during the emergence of movements supporting the free distribution of software and the distribution of open source software.
Both types of licenses in one or another way give the right to run, study, share, and modify the software.
The main difference between them is how the distribution of derivative software occurs.
Copyleft licenses require that any derivative software has to be distributed under the same licensing conditions as the base one.
And permissive licenses allow you to distribute derivative software on other conditions, including making it proprietary.

next slide

The most common copyleft license class is  GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL).

next slide

The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989.
Version 1 of the GNU GPL was released on 25 February 1989.
It resolved two major problems.

next slide

The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only
 - executable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. 
To prevent this, GPL stated that if you copy and distribute copies of the software
you must also make the source code available under the same licensing terms.
The second problem was that distributors might add restrictions on the distribution of the software.
To prevent this, GPL stated that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPL.

next slide

And last one type, permissive licenses.

next slide

The main representatives of the permissive license class are: MIT, Apache and  BSD licences. 
They are very similar, but differ in a number of details.

next slide

MIT license permits reuse of software in proprietary projects,
with the condition that any future licensed software must contain a copy of the license terms and copyright notice of the base software.
The MIT license is short, clear, and easy to understand.
The disadvantage is that anyone can take software licensed under MIT,
change the branding, and sell it as proprietary software.

next slide

Apache license allows users of the software to distribute, modify, or otherwise use software for any purpose,
as long as the user complies with the license terms.
The terms state that users can’t remove existing copyright, patent, trademarks and attribution notices.
This license is considered by many to offer the best patent protection among the permissive licenses.
A limitation of this license for developers is that it requires you to add prominent notifications of any changes you make to a file.

next slide

Let’s now look at how the community uses these types of licenses.

next slide

Historically, the most used were the GPL licenses.
First of all, this was due to the fact that free software was created by enthusiasts inspired by the ideology of free software distribution.
But as the open source industry has evolved, it has become clear that finding the right balance of community engagement and a business model is a key decision.
And than copyleft licences with very strict rules has started to lose battle to the permissive licenses. On the graph you can see the rise of usage of permissive licenses.

next slide

MIT’s permissive license is used on 51% of Github projects.
Apache, the runner-up, is used by another 14.8%, and 6.6% use  BSD-like license.

And final question. What kins of license should I use?  
if you use open source software within your software development project,
any permissive license should be fine.
But while understanding the differences between permissive licenses is important,
far more important is drawing the line between them and their unfriendly counterparts, copyleft.
If you are a user of open source components,
copyleft licenses can “infect” your entire code base and impose restrictions that might prevent you from commercializing.
If you are a developer of open source software,
copyleft can significantly limit the appeal and adoption of your components.
